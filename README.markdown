#html-go

This is a framework I start to work with when creating (x)html/css/js projects

## Stucture

That is typical directory structure I use

* `/css` - css stylesheets
* `/js` - all the javascript
* `/images` - site images, remember to optimize them (http://smush.it/)

## Additional information

Some code snippets and concepts are based on: 
* Blueprint css framework (http://blueprintcss.org) 
* Gerrit van Aaken's HTML/CSS/JS-Kickstart (http://praegnanz.de/weblog/htmlcssjs-kickstart)
* HTML5 enabling script for IE (http://remysharp.com/2009/01/07/html5-enabling-script/)
