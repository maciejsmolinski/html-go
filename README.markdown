# HTML-go


You wonder what **HTML-go** is, right ?
  
  
**HTML-go** is a bunch of files I start to work with when creating (x)html/css/js projects.  
The framework is a result of all my work spent with front-end development.  

If you like it and/or have any suggestions ? Feel free to contact me or just fork the project.  

## Directory Stucture

That is typical directory structure I use

* `/css` - css stylesheets
* `/js` - all the javascript
* `/images` - site images, remember to optimize them (http://smush.it/)

## The code - HTML

* HTML5 doctype


    > Firstly, the framework uses HTML5 doctype and that's why there are two files:
    >
    > * `index.html` with HTML4/XHTML markup
    > * `index.html5.html` with HTML5 markup


* chrome frame


    > Then.. We turn [google chrome frame](http://code.google.com/intl/pl-PL/chrome/chromeframe/) ON if user has previously installed it on his computer
    > 
    > * `<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="chrome=1">`


* javascript support


    > Next, a little trick to append .js class to the body tag if the browser supports javascript [source](http://www.webkrauts.de/2008/12/14/sehr-sehr-schnelle-seiten-website-performance-best-practice-teil-2/)
    >
    > * `<script type="text/javascript">document.documentElement.className += " js";</script>`



* body ie6/ie7 classes


    > Basing on [source](http://codecandies.de/2008/12/12/conditional-comments-wenige-requests/) I've added..
    >
    > * `.ie6` class for <= IE6 browsers
    > * `.ie7` class for IE7 browser
    >
    > ..to the body tag


* HTML5 support for IE


    > Ok.. we've almost reached --EOF-- and we find:
    >
    > * `<!--[if IE]><script src="http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"></script><![endif]-->`
    >
    > The script adds very basic support (but does!) for IE browsers


* javascript


    > And below we place all our javascript, just to make our site load faster
    > 
    > * `jQuery 1.3.2 min` is being served by google
    > * `js/js-engine.js` served locally, that's where the js magic takes place

## The code - CSS

> nothing here, yet!...


## TODO:

* JS

    > * add `install google chrome frame` notice for IE

* else

    > * write documentation => update readme (css code, additional info etc.)

## Additional information

Some code snippets and concepts are based on:

* [YUI 3](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/)
* [Blueprint css framework](http://blueprintcss.org) 
* [Gerrit van Aaken's HTML/CSS/JS-Kickstart](http://praegnanz.de/weblog/htmlcssjs-kickstart)
