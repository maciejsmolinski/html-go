#html-go

This is a framework I start to work with when creating (x)html/css/js projects

## Stucture

That is typical directory structure I use

* `/css` - css stylesheets
* `/js` - all the javascript
* `/images` - site images, remember to optimize them (http://smush.it/)

## Additional information

Some code snippets and concepts are based on: blueprint css framework (http://blueprintcss.org) and Gerrit van Aaken's HTML/CSS/JS-Kickstart (http://praegnanz.de)
