### Directory Stucture:

That is directory structure I use in framework

* `css/` - css stylesheets
* `js/` - all the javascript
* `images/` - site images, remember to optimize them (<http://smush.it/>)

### Framework in shortcut:

* **HTML5** doctype
* [**HEAD.JS**](http://headjs.com) responsible for loading scripts in parallel
* **jQuery 1.4.4** provided by Google CDN
* [Modified **IE6 Notice** PL/EN](http://shapeshed.github.com/ie6-notice/)
* Separate **IE stylesheet**
* **Appended `.js` class** to body tag if user's browser supports javascript

### Unnecessary code ?

`css/extended.css` is mostly form styling stylesheet, I use it to speed up my backend coding, if you don't wish to use it, just **delete the file and remove ** from `css/style.css` this line:

		@import url(extended.css);

### Additional information
